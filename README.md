# 🍽️ Dalouna Restaurant Website

## 📝 Description
This project is a simple, fully responsive restaurant website built using **HTML** and **CSS only**.  
It showcases a clean and modern layout for **Dalouna Restaurant**, including sections for About, Menu, Hours, Location, and Contact.

The design automatically adjusts for smaller screens — when the screen width decreases, the navigation becomes a **hamburger-style menu** for easy mobile browsing.
